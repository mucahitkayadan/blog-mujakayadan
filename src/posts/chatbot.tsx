# Creating a Virtual Chatbot Assistant for Your Static Website with AWS

## Demo Video

In this blog post, we'll walk you through the process of creating a virtual chatbot assistant for your static website using AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and CloudFront. Whether you're a developer looking to enhance your portfolio or an organization aiming to boost user interaction on your site, this guide will provide you with the steps to implement a scalable and cost-effective solution.

## Project Overview

The chatbot is designed to provide a seamless conversational interface for users visiting a static website. Here's the AWS architecture we'll be using:

1. **S3**: Hosts the static website.
2. **CloudFront**: Distributes the website globally with low latency.
3. **Lambda**: Powers the chatbot's serverless backend logic.
4. **DynamoDB**: Stores conversation history and user-specific data.

To follow along, you can refer to the source code on GitHub:
[Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/mucahitkayadan/portfolio) and [Lambda Function Code](https://github.com/mucahitkayadan/portfolio/tree/main/lambda-deploy-cjs).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- An AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and AWS services.
- A static website ready to deploy (or use the example provided in the repository).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Static Website

### Hosting on S3
1. Upload your static website files to an S3 bucket.
2. Configure the bucket for static website hosting.
3. Enable public read access or set up appropriate IAM policies if using CloudFront for access control.

### Distributing via CloudFront
1. Create a CloudFront distribution for your S3 bucket.
2. Set up a custom domain name and HTTPS using an ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate.
3. Test your setup to ensure your website is globally accessible.

## Step 2: Implement the Chatbot Backend

The chatbot's backend is powered by AWS Lambda. This serverless approach ensures that you only pay for the compute time you use.

### Writing the Lambda Function
The Lambda function logic can be found [here](https://github.com/mucahitkayadan/portfolio/tree/main/lambda-deploy-cjs). Here's a high-level overview of its functionality:
- Receives input from the chatbot interface on your static website.
- Processes user queries using predefined intents and responses.
- Logs interactions to DynamoDB for future use.

### Deploying the Lambda Function
1. Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
2. Upload your function code or link the repository for automated deployments.
3. Set up appropriate IAM roles to allow the function access to DynamoDB and other resources.

## Step 3: Set Up DynamoDB
DynamoDB is used to store user interactions and metadata. This data can be used for analytics or to improve your chatbot's responses.

1. Create a DynamoDB table with the necessary attributes (e.g., user ID, timestamp, query, response).
2. Configure read and write permissions for your Lambda function.
3. Test the integration to ensure data is correctly logged.

## Step 4: Integrate the Chatbot with Your Website

### Adding the Chatbot Interface
The chatbot interface is implemented as part of your static website. Use JavaScript and HTML to:
- Create a chat window UI.
- Capture user input and send it to the Lambda function.
- Display the responses dynamically on the webpage.

### Connecting to the Lambda Function
Use AWS API Gateway to expose your Lambda function as an HTTP endpoint:
1. Create a new API Gateway and link it to your Lambda function.
2. Deploy the API and note the endpoint URL.
3. Update your website's JavaScript to send user queries to this endpoint.

## Step 5: Deploy and Test

1. Deploy your website to S3 and invalidate the CloudFront cache.
2. Interact with the chatbot to test its functionality.
3. Debug and refine responses based on user feedback and logs stored in DynamoDB.

## Conclusion
By combining AWS services such as Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and CloudFront, you can build a robust chatbot assistant for your static website. This architecture ensures scalability, low latency, and cost-efficiency.
